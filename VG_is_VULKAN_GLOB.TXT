

Better to write lots of throwaway code than
try to do it all perfect the first time.
Takes a few iterations anyhow.

Will name folders with numbers based on what
current iteration I am on.

Namespace will be:
    VG1 for 01 folder
    VG2 for 02 folder
    VG3 for 03 folder
    ....
    VG10 for 10 folder
    VG11 for 11 folder
    VG12 for 12 folder
    ....
    VG100 for 100 folder
    ....
    ETC.
