//: ACTUAL: ARR_SIZ_NUM_RULES:
//:   TYPO: ARR_SIZ_NAM_RULES:
//:     "siz,num,arr" may also be built into the
//:     name of the variable instead of added as
//:     a "kind". Use whatever combination allows
//:     you to keep the base-name of the variable
//:     as xxx_xxx.
//:         EX: siz(tik_tok)  arr(tik_tok)
//:         OR:     siz_tok       arr_tok
//:
//:     siz,num,arr are all local.
//:     They are not qualified with the library name
//:     or obfuscated because they are local variables.
//:
//:     Do NOT make them file scope.

//: NESTING:
//| The answer to that is that if you need more than 3       |//
//| levels of indentation,youâ€™re screwed anyway,and should   |//
//| fix your program.                                        |//
