HP_VS_CP:Homopool_Vs_Constpool
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
CONSTPOOL: Pool for putting constant values on heap.
 HOMOPOOL: Pool for reserving memory that WON'T be freed.

CONSTPOOL: 
    1: Set a KNOWN number of values.
       (You always know how many calls to CONSTPOOL     )
       (Will be made for the lifetime of your program   )
       (using static analysis of code.                  )
       (AKA: Don't call this in a fucking dynamic loop! )

    2: Reserves the memory.
    3. SETS the values in memory for you.

HOMOPOOL:
    1: Used for an UNKNOWN number of values.
    2: Reserves the memory.
    3: DOES NOT set the values in memory for you.

    Use this for allocating more dyanmic memory that
    will NOT BE FREED for the lifetime of the program.

    Because of this, we can SHRINK the size of the pool 
    once the program has reached homeostatis with
    calls to HOMOPOOL.
